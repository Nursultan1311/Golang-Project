Report 8

This week to our project was added filtering by book rating and user can give additional rating for books.
Book rating will be changed every time when user give a rating

Filter by rating: you send the rating for backend, so we get all books which rating higher or equal to target rating.
Give a rating: Only user which was registered can give rating for books.
So when you send the request you need add email and password.
We take the email and check for existing this user then compare the password, only then we give rating for target book.
